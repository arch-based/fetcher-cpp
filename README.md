<h1 align="center">fetcher</h1>
<p align="center">A pretty system information tool written in bash</p><br>

This rewrite of fetcher prioritizes speed and resource efficiency by focusing 
on essential data retrieval with minimal overhead. This makes it a good
choice when you need system information quickly and simply. The only tool
that lets you become an elitist of Arch Linux by showing you like CPP/C++.

 The"fetcher" script is a lightweight Bash tool that displays system information very quickly but it quickly got rewritten in C++ because of its immense slowness :( it was 0.3 seconds away from our goal of 0.0 seconds.  
This focus on efficiency and visual appeal makes fetcher a great option for users who value both functionality and style.

This tool is mainly focused to arch-based distros and arch linux so don't be surprised if you do not see a logo of your distro here.
